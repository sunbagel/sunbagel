## About me:
I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I'm deeply interested in distributed systems, large-scale cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. 

Outside of tech, you can find me playing volleyball, basketball, and training to jump higher! üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

## Experience:
- Prev SDE intern @AWS Lambda, where I researched and prototyped infrastructure for large-scale stream processing using Apache Flink
- Prev Backend @NCR Voyix
  
- Prev Full Stack at @UW Blueprint, building tech for social good
